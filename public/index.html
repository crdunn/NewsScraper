		  <hr class="my-4">
			<p>Founded in 1988, <a href="https://www.theonion.com/" target="_blank">The Onion</a> is a satirical newspaper that publishes parody news articles.  Topics covered range from satire of current political events, to surreal absurdist pieces, to dramatic reporting on mundane events.  The company has successfully created a unique and recognizable style to their satire, and its audience can clearly recognize “an Onion article” from the headline alone.</p>
			<p>However, sometimes the truth can be just as strange as a comedian’s imagination.  The subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/" target="_blank">/r/nottheonion</a> is an online community dedicated to cataloging real news reports that sound like they were written by The Onion.</p>
			<p>Can you tell the difference?  Hit the “Scrape” button below to pull headlines from both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheOnion/" target="_blank">/r/TheOnion</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/" target="_blank">/r/nottheonion</a> .  Choose whether you think it’s a real headline or a parody one, make a note about why you think so; then click the link to see if you were right!  (or just hover your Mouse over it and see where the link would take you.  I can’t actually guarantee that a link posted by strangers on Reddit is a wise thing to click on…)</p>
